                                    I am Italian-Ghanian born in Vicenza, Italy. When I was one year old, 
                                    I joined my cousins in Ghana. For the next five years, we all lived 
                                    together with my grandma and my aunt. I don’t have many memories of 
                                    those days, but I vividly remember the colours, the

                                of the people and the taste of the foods. When I turned six, my father came 
                                from Italy to bring me back to Vicenza. I was raised in a multicultural 
                                environment, which helped me shape my open mindset. More than two years ago, 
                                I decided to move to London to face new challenges and discover myself.

                                <p>
                                    I have always been passionate about computers and tech in general. I remember, back in 
                                    2008 installing Ubuntu on my home computer. However, I never dared to pursue a career 
                                    in software development. Different factors led me to think that 
                                    I wasn’t good enough, and my passion laid elsewhere. How wrong I was at the time.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My long journey to realisation took me through different stages:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Study chemical engineering: I loved the logic behind math, chemistry and physics.</li>
                                    <li>Work as a scientific subject’s tutor/mentor for students in Vicenza.</li>
                                    <li>Cultivating my passion for video editing. </li>
                                    <li>Work as a digital marketing assistant: I love being creative and build things from 
                                        scratch.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    In 2018 I realised that I wasn't happy neither satisfied, so I decided to move to London
                                     to get international exposure and exciting opportunities. I worked as a Sales Lead 
                                     Generator until March 2020 when I was put in furlough. That was the wake-up 
                                     call I needed to conquer my fears and work hard towards my dream to become a software 
                                     developer.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I love coding because it makes your ideas become a reality. Coding is logical and creative 
                                    at the same time. As a creative person with good analytical thinking, I love this duo. 
                                    I love thinking about an idea and how I could realise it, using HTML and CSS for the 
                                    style and the display of the content and JavaScript for all the logics and 
                                    functionalities behind it.

                                    All my experience led me to where I am now. I am very proud of this journey because it led me exactly where 
                                    I wanted to be, helping me know myself better and achieving my dreams.

                                    Coding my website for FAC2021 was a fun, challenging and gratifying experience. 
                                    It allowed me to logically think about functionalities and elements and creatively 
                                    imagine how to showcase them on my application website.

                                    Back in March, when I started my coding journey, despite all the stories about the first “Hello World”,
                                    the program that hooked me to coding was a "simple" calculator. I was completely captivated, but I 
                                    realised that I had a long way to go if I wanted to convert this passion to a profession.
                                
                                    During this exciting journey, my girlfriend told me about this web-developer who shared his own experience 
                                    to become a software developer and how the FAC Bootcamp shaped his life and his view on coding and 
                                    the community around it. 
                         
                                    After hearing this career-changing story, I was excited. Therefore, I quickly did some
                                    googling and some networking to directly connect with old alumni from

                                                But after joining the FAC community, everything changed. I was in a place where everyone 
                                                had the same dream, they were actively working for a common goal. I felt I was in a safe place.
