                                  I am an Italian-Ghanian born in Vicenza, Italy. When I was one year old, I joined my cousins in Ghana. 
                                  For the next five years, we all lived together with my grandma and my aunt. 
                                    I don’t have many memories of those days, but I vividly remember the colours, the

                                   Around six years old, my father came from Italy to bring back to Vicenza. 
                                   I was raised in a multicultural environment, which helped me shape my open-minded mentality.
                                   More than two years ago, I decided to move to London to face new challenges and discover myself.

                                <p>
                                    I have always been passionate about computers and tech in general. I remember, 
                                    back in 2008 installing Ubuntu to my house computer. However, I never dared to 
                                    pursue a career in software development. Different factors led me to think that 
                                    I wasn’t good enough, and my passion laid elsewhere, and how wrong I was. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My long journey to realization took me through different stages:
                                </p>

                                    <li>Study chemical engineering: I loved the logic part about math, chemistry and physics. </li>
                                    <li>Work as a tutor/mentor for young guys in my Vicenza for scientific subjects.</li>
                                    <li>Cultivating my passion for video editing </li>
                                    <li>Worked as a digital marketing assistant: I loved being a creative position where I needed to create from scratch.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    In 2018 I realized that I wasn't happy neither satisfied, so I decided to move 
                                    to London to get international exposure and exciting opportunities. 
                                    I worked as a Sales Lead Generator till March 2020 when I was put in furlough. 
                                    That was the wake-up call I needed to conquer my fears and work hard toward my 
                                    dream to become a software developer.
                                </p>

                                    I love coding, first of all, because it makes your ideas become a reality. Coding is logical and at
                                    the same time artistic. As a creative person who has analytical thinking, I love this relationship. 
                                    I love thinking about an idea and how I could realize it, using HTML and CSS for the style and 
                                    the display of the content and JavaScript for all the logics and functionalities behind it.

                                    Back in March, when I started my coding journey, despite all the stories about the first “Hello World”,
                                     the program that hooked me to coding was a "simple" calculator. I was completely captivated, but I 
                                     realised that I had a long way to go if I wanted to convert this passion to a profession.

                                    During this exciting journey, my girlfriend told me about this web-developer who shared his own experience 
                                    to become a software developer and how this coding Bootcamp shaped his life and his view on coding and 
                                    the community around it.

                                    After hearing this career-changing story, I was excited. Therefore, I quickly did some
                                    googling and some networking to directly connect with old alumni from

                                                But after joining the FAC community, everything changed. I was in a place where everyone 
                                                had the same dream, they were actively working for a common goal. I felt I was in a safe place.
